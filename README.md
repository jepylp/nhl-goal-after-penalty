# nhl-goal-after-penalty
Check to see if a goal was scored shortly after a penalty has expired 

Made in python 3

Change season in run.py to change the season that I run.

Currently only working for the current 2020-2021 season.

Need to add a CLI to accept arguments for the season to run, or specific game (easier to test).
